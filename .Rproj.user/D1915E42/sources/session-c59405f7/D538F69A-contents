# Impact of Data Handling Errors on Statistical Analysis

## Overview

This report examines the influence of data handling errors on the analysis of a dataset purportedly sampled from a normal distribution with a mean of one and a standard deviation of one. Through simulation, we explore the implications of instrument limitations and preprocessing mistakes on statistical conclusions, particularly the estimation of the population mean in relation to the null hypothesis that it is greater than zero.

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:


-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.
